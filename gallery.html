                  The sun is a star located in the center of the solar system. It is almost an ideal sphere intertwined with hot plasma and magnetic field. The diameter of the sun is approximately 1,392,000 (1.392×10⁶) kilometers, which is equivalent to 109 times the diameter of the earth; its volume is approximately 1.3 million times that of the earth; and its mass is approximately 2×10³⁰ kilograms (330,000 times that of the earth). From the point of view of chemical composition, about three-quarters of the mass of the sun is now hydrogen, and the rest is almost all helium, including oxygen, carbon, neon, iron and other heavy elements with a mass of less than 2%, using nuclear fusion. Release light and heat into space.

It is commonly known as the moon or moon in Chinese, and it was also called Taiyin, Xuantu, Chanjuan, and Yupan in ancient times. The moon is the fifth largest satellite in the solar system. Its average radius is about 1737.10 kilometers, which is equivalent to 0.273 times the radius of the earth; its mass is close to 7.342×1022 kilograms, which is equivalent to 0.0123 times that of the earth. The surface of the moon is full of impact craters formed by the impact of small celestial bodies. The average distance between the moon and the earth is about 384,400 kilometers, which is about 30 times the diameter of the earth.</p>

In ancient China, it was called Chenxing. Sima Qian, the author of "Historical Records of the Book of Heaven" in the Western Han Dynasty, discovered from actual observations that the star was gray, which was associated with the theory of the Five Elements, and named it Mercury because black is water.The orbital period is 87.9691 days, and it will rendezvous with the earth once in 116 days. The revolution speed is much faster than other planets in the solar system. Mercury is the planet with the largest temperature difference between day and night on its surface. The atmosphere is extremely thin and cannot effectively store heat. The temperature in the equator during the day can reach 432°C, and it can drop to -172°C at night.</p>

Venus was called Taibai, Star or Daxiao in ancient China. It appeared in the East in the morning and was called Qiming, and in the West in the evening it was called Chang Gung. In the Western Han Dynasty, Sima Qian, the author of "Historical Records-Tianguanshu", discovered from actual observations that Taibai was white, which was associated with the theory of "Five Elements" and officially named it Venus. The English name is derived from Venus, the goddess of love and beauty in Roman mythology. Ancient Greeks called it Aphrodite. It is also the goddess of love and beauty in Greek mythology.</p>

It is one of the four terrestrial planets in the solar system. In ancient Europe, Mars was called Mars, and the god of war in ancient Roman mythology was also called the "red planet". In ancient Chinese, it was called “Fantasy” because it was shining like fire, and its location and brightness were often unpredictable. Its orange-red appearance is because the surface is covered by hematite (iron oxide). The diameter of Mars is about half of that of the earth. Its rotation axis inclination and rotation period are similar to those of the earth, but the revolution period is twice that of the earth. Mars can be as bright as -2.9 mag, but it is dimmer than Jupiter for most of the time.</p>

The ancients already knew this planet, and the Romans named it after the main god Jupiter. In ancient China, Jupiter was called the Sui Xing, and it orbited the celestial sphere for about 12 years, which was the same as the Earth Branch. In the Western Han Dynasty, Sima Qian, the author of "Historical Records-Tianguanshu", discovered from actual observations that the Sui Xing had a blue color, which was associated with the "Five Elements" theory and officially named it Jupiter. Looking at Jupiter from the earth, the apparent magnitude can be as high as -2.94, and shadows of objects can already be illuminated on the ground. After the moon and Venus, Jupiter is the third celestial body in the night sky on average brightness.</p>

The ancient Chinese Saturn was named by the ancient Chinese based on the five elements theory and the color (yellow) of Saturn observed by the naked eye, and it is also called Zhenxing (often written as "filling star"). The English name of Saturn comes from Saturn, the god of agriculture in Roman mythology. Saturn has a significant planetary ring system, the main components are ice particles and a small amount of rock debris and dust. There are 82 satellites of Saturn that have been confirmed, which is the most among the eight planets.Saturn is a gas giant planet, mainly composed of hydrogen, with a small amount of helium and a small amount of elements. The inner core includes rock and ice, and the outer periphery is covered by several layers of metallic hydrogen and gas.</p>

Babylon once used seven lunar days to record the sun, in the order of sun, moon, fire, water, wood, gold, and earth, from Sunday to Saturday, so it is also called "week". It was introduced to China in the 8th century. The concept of the calendar with Qi Yao as the week was introduced into China from India, and the concept of the week with Europe seems to have originated from the Mesopotamia Ancient Babylonian civilization, which is the same lunar calendar.</p>
